Application : Test kadama

Featueres :
Animated splash screen : LaunchView.swift
Image Cache : CachedImageView.swift (NSCache and File manager storage)
List of pokemons : ViewController.swift
Pokemon Detail : DetailViewController.swift
Api manager : ServiceManager.swift (URLSession)
Local storage : PersistanceStore.swift (Core data)
Dark mode support : YES
Programmatic UI : YES
Architecture used : MVVM / MVC
SourceControl : GIT (Local)
Time spent : 15 hours (Most of it was due to the fact as required data was not coming in same api otherwise it could have been completed in 4-5 hours)


Issues faced :
1) I did not find any api that returns all the required data in one api. The main api only returned the url to get the data so i have to manually call every detail api and then store the details locally. Normally any important basic data comes in a single api like name , image etc and another api is called for any more details
{
  "count": 1118,
  "next": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=20&limit=20",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "bulbasaur",
      "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/"
    },

2) Due to time constraints , i was not able to do much UI/UX on detail page.
